title: "How is SHR different from FHIR®?"
paragraphs:
    - 
      p: "FHIR is an exchange standard, not a content specification. FHIR defines high level classes of things, such as “person,” “immunization,” and “observation”, that might be exchanged between healthcare systems. It provides no information about what particular persons, immunizations, or observations might be important. In contrast, the SHR lists specific things that should be part of every health record, for example, specific persons (e.g., an emergency contact), specific immunizations (e.g., the date of the last tetanus shot), and specific observations (e.g., the patients fasting glucose)."

      p: "The SHR Collaborative pinpoints those specific elements by leveraging existing medical record models and physician expertise to account for the data needs of primary and emergency care providers. The SHR also addresses the dynamic needs of patients and their caregivers over the course of life by including a recommended structure and content for documenting many variables related to social determinants of health."
